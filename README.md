# FPGA-Snake
Implementing a “Snake” moving in Patterned way on a 7-Segment display using FPGA MAX10 Board with a push button for changing pattern of movement.

To simulate moving, the code (written in System Verilog Hardware Description Language) turns on/off some adjacent segments with a fixed delay).
